TODO
look up how to use the enumerate function
This specific problem is not a typical two-pointer problem.
A two-pointer technique usually involves iterating over two parts of an array
simultaneously,
typically when working with sorted arrays, intervals, or finding pairs/triplets.

For finding the missing number, sorting the array and using two
indices (start and faster) doesn't logically apply, as the problem
is about finding a single missing value in a range of numbers.
Key Observations for Missing Number Problem

    The numbers are in the range [0, n], where n is the length of the array.
    Exactly one number is missing.
    Sorting isn't required for this problem â€” there are more efficient approaches.
